# Multimodal Deepfake Detection and Explainability

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust system for detecting deepfakes using a multimodal approach. It incorporates machine learning techniques with model explainability, allowing users to understand the reasoning behind detection outcomes.

## Features

- **Multimodal Detection**: Utilises multimodal data to enhance detection accuracy.
- **Three-Class Classification**: Detects and categorizes deepfakes into three distinct classes based on combinations of manipulations
- **Explainability**: Provides insights into the model's decision-making process, helping users understand how detections are made.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook**: A notebook is provided for experimentation and demonstration of detection capabilities
